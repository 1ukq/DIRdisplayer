# DIRdisplayer

When I report on my IT projects I like the person to have a global view of the project architecture. With this in mind, the DIRdisplayer describes the architecture of a file.

It is easily launched in the following way:
`python3 display.py <path_to_dir> [path_to_file]`

If path_to_file is not given as argument, the output is displayed on `stdout`, otherwise in the file given as argument.
